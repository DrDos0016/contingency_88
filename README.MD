# Contingency 88

Contingency 88 is a game created for the Something Awful GameDev Challenge VI. The theme was "Death and Taxes". Having recently uncovered an almost complete version of the source code I chode to make it publically available.

Keep in mind that the competiton was to create a game in just 30 days, so the code is very much a mess.
