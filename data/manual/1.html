================================================================================<br>
BODY:<br>
     Dear Mr. Miller,<br>
<br>
After sixteen years of service to the good people of Roosylvania. It pains me to 
see the polls showing a clear loss for reelection this November. After 
numerous scandals, I fear I have lost all credibility with the voters of this 
state and will no longer be able to fulfill the wishes of the party.<br>
<br>
Most worrying, are the numerous calls for my resignation from the Blues. The 
more they yell, the more people seem to listen.<br>
<br>
The people of this state are ignorant and lazy. They do not understand that our 
vision is the correct one and are instead actively being deceived by the Blue 
party.<br>
<br>
As my position and the party's power are at stake I am afraid I must request 
the initiation of <span style="color:#FF5555">Contingency 88</span>. 
<br>
I respect any concerns you have, but wish to remind you that your employment 
is riding on this election as much as mine. Please get to work as soon as 
possible.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
   Governor Anderson<br>
