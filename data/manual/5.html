<br>
The <span style="color:#FF5555">Contingency 88</span> software relies heavily on the use of a mouse. If you are unfamiliar with this peripheral please delegate use of this software to someone with a background in advanced computing.
<br>
<br>
<span class="cyan">Left clicking</span> on a tile will zone it as the selected district or if the tile is 
already the selected district, unzone it entirely. You may hold the mouse button 
down to zone multiple tiles with a single button press.<br>
<br>
<span class="cyan">Right clicking</span> on a tile will fill that area with the selected district, or if the tile is already the
selected district, unzone the area. <span class="red">This feature is a bit buggy at times.</span> For best results, create an
enclosed area and then fill the inside, ideally clicking on a tile just below the top border.<br>
<br>
<span class="cyan">The mouse wheel</span> can be used to cycle through which district you will zone tiles as. If you do not have a mouse with a wheel you can simply <span class="cyan">press the appropriate number key</span> to select a district<br>
<br>
After completing your zoning, simply <span class="cyan">click the red FINALIZE button</span> in the sidebar to confirm your choice and run the election.<br>
<br>
However there are <span class="red">requirements</span> that MUST be met before finalizing. The percent of tiles undistricted must read <span class="red">0%</span>. Also the difference between the largest district and the smallest district must <span class="red">not exceed 20%</span>. Ignoring either of these will bring too much attention to the districting process and be met with overwhelming hostility.<br>
<br>
If you are ever forgetful about how to use this software effectively, <span class="cyan">hit F1</span> to open a copy of the manual.<br><br>
When the time comes to exit the program, on most screens you may simply <span class="cyan">press Escape</span>. Your current progress in a level
is <span class="red">NOT saved</span>. However you will be able to start from that level again in the future.
